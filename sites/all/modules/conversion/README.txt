Conversion
---------------------

Conversion provides conversion optimization improvements for Drupal.

* Node Before Register - Allows anonymous users to create a node, and then register, becoming the author of that node.  The idea is to draw users in byallowing them to create content, then requiring registration in order to publish that content. The advantage over the traditional register-first approach is that users are more likely to sign up if they are first enticed into creating content.

Setup: After installing Conversion module, give anonymous users permission to create the type of node you will be using.  Anonymous users will then automatically be redirected to register after creating a node.
